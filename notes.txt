Note there might be astrometry issue that could cause some
of the failures

fracdev priors

    run-vd04
        - fracdev truncated norm, very liberal
        failure with object_flags 3.2% in C09

    run-vd05
        - fracdev truncated norm [0,1] far fewer failures but
        magdiff with v04 skewed
        failure with object_flags 0.9% in C09

        Also seems to get stuck more in a local minimum at e.g. fracdev=1
        and this is not that uncommon

    run-vd06
        - fracdev prior sinh scale 0.2, looks quite similar to v04 in magdiff
        failure a bit better than v04
        failure with object_flags 3.0% in C09

    run-vd07
        - fracdev prior sinh scale 0.1
        failure with object_flags 3.4% in C09

    run-vd08
        - fracdev prior sinh scale 0.3
        failure with object_flags 3.2% in C09

    run-vdexp01
        - exp
        2.3% failures of object_flags

    run-vdexp02
        - exp ,shifted log-normal T
        2.8% failures of object_flags

    run-vdtcen01
        - fitvd-tcen01 bdf model, but with
              cen prior sigma 0.05 (rather than 0.263 as usual)
        - 2.7% failures of object_flags
            - comparable to the exp model, so maybe this is important

        - if this works, should maybe try with fracdev just normal

    run-dtcen01
        - same as vdtcen01 but des only
        - 2.0% failure

    run-vdfdz01
        - prior centered at zero for fracdev
        2.4%

    run-d02
        - fitvd-deep07
        - griz only
        - fracdev normal 0.5/0.1 with [0,1] bounds
        - cen 0.05

wide field
----------
- run-wide01t
    - fitvd-wide01t
    - full deblending
    - circular mask
- run-wide02t
    - fitvd-wide02t
    - full deblending
    - uberseg
    - some 0.02 level mag differences showing up

- run-wide03t
    - fitvd-wide03t
    - same as wide02t but better bounds handling, fracdev [0,1]

- run-wide04t
    - fitvd-wide04t
    - added
        - outlier rejection
        - trim images to [32, 64]
        - very tight cen bounds
        - no bounds on fracdev
        - fracdev prior gauss 0.5/0.3
        - flat T/flux bounds
        - in code fixing bad flux guesses
        + probably want to add bounds on fracdev at [-3,4]
        + may want to try also without trimming and without outlier rejections

next may want to add trimming of stamps

- run-widesof01t
    - fitvd-widesof01t
    - no deblending
    - circular mask
    - mags strongly skewed compared to deblending run wide01t

- run-widesof02t
    - fitvd-widesof02t
    - no deblending
    - ubserseg
    - agrees better with deblending run wide01t
    - agrees best with deblending with uberseg, wide02t

- run-widesof03t
    - fitvd-widesof03t
    - same as widesof03t but better bounds handling, fracdev [0,1]

- run-widefdz01t
    - fitvd-widefdz02t
    - fracdev prior centered at zero
    - full deblending
    - uberseg
    - whoops, bad guesses, but might beok
    - hmm.offsets [0.009, 0.012, 0.014, 0.021]
    - failures are similar
    - the number of objects with fracdev < 0 is nearly half.  This might be ok
      but it worries me a bit

- run-widefdz02t
    - same as run-widefdz01t but fixed guess
    - even more than half with fracdev < 0 now
    - also larger offsets from fiducial run
                  [0.015, 0.015, 0.019, 0.025]
      medians still small though

- we think most faint galaxies look more like disks than bulges
- the prior should be closer to 0 than 1
- where should it be?  0.1 +/- 0.1 ?
