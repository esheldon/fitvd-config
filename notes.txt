Note there might be astrometry issue that could cause some
of the failures

fracdev priors

    run-vd04
        - fracdev truncated norm, very liberal
        failure with object_flags 3.2% in C09

    run-vd05
        - fracdev truncated norm [0,1] far fewer failures but
        magdiff with v04 skewed
        failure with object_flags 0.9% in C09

        Also seems to get stuck more in a local minimum at e.g. fracdev=1
        and this is not that uncommon

    run-vd06
        - fracdev prior sinh scale 0.2, looks quite similar to v04 in magdiff
        failure a bit better than v04
        failure with object_flags 3.0% in C09

    run-vd07
        - fracdev prior sinh scale 0.1
        failure with object_flags 3.4% in C09

    run-vd08
        - fracdev prior sinh scale 0.3
        failure with object_flags 3.2% in C09

    run-vdexp01
        - exp
        2.3% failures of object_flags

    run-vdexp02
        - exp ,shifted log-normal T
        2.8% failures of object_flags

    run-vdtcen01
        - fitvd-tcen01 bdf model, but with
              cen prior sigma 0.05 (rather than 0.263 as usual)
        - 2.7% failures of object_flags
            - comparable to the exp model, so maybe this is important

        - if this works, should maybe try with fracdev just normal

    run-dtcen01
        - same as vdtcen01 but des only
        - 2.0% failure

    run-vdfdz01
        - prior centered at zero for fracdev
        2.4%

    run-d02
        - fitvd-deep07
        - griz only
        - fracdev normal 0.5/0.1 with [0,1] bounds
        - cen 0.05

    run-d03
        - fitvd-d03
        - similar to run-wide04t for wide field
        - griz only
        - trimming images
        - fracdev normal 0.5/0.3 with [-3,4] bounds
        - cen 0.001


wide field
----------
- run-wide01t
    - fitvd-wide01t
    - full deblending
    - circular mask
- run-wide02t
    - fitvd-wide02t
    - full deblending
    - uberseg
    - some 0.02 level mag differences showing up

- run-wide03t
    - fitvd-wide03t
    - same as wide02t but better bounds handling, fracdev [0,1]

- run-wide04t
    - fitvd-wide04t
    - added
        - outlier rejection
        - trim images to [32, 64]
        - very tight cen bounds
        - fracdev prior gauss 0.5/0.3
            - loose bounds on fracdev [-3,4]
        - flat T/flux bounds
        - in code fixing bad flux guesses

- run-wide05t
    - test with different TdByTe, don't use

- run-wide06t
    - fitvd-wide04t
    - fracdev prior gauss 0.5/0.3
        - bounds on fracdev [-0.18, 2.0] safe for TdByTe=1
        - crazy high failure rate

- run-wide04t2
    - rerunning wide04t with new code to make sure still works ok
    - if looks ok, need to figure out why wide06t failed so bad
        - fracdev bounds
            - maybe there are real negative pixels its trying to fit?
        - coellip psf (seems unlikely)


next may want to add trimming of stamps

- run-widesof01t
    - fitvd-widesof01t
    - no deblending
    - circular mask
    - mags strongly skewed compared to deblending run wide01t

- run-widesof02t
    - fitvd-widesof02t
    - no deblending
    - ubserseg
    - agrees better with deblending run wide01t
    - agrees best with deblending with uberseg, wide02t

- run-widesof03t
    - fitvd-widesof03t
    - same as widesof03t but better bounds handling, fracdev [0,1]
- run-widesof04t
    - fitvd-widesof04t
    - same as fitvd-wide04t but without FoF group finding

- run-widefdz01t
    - fitvd-widefdz02t
    - fracdev prior centered at zero
    - full deblending
    - uberseg
    - whoops, bad guesses, but might beok
    - hmm.offsets [0.009, 0.012, 0.014, 0.021]
    - failures are similar
    - the number of objects with fracdev < 0 is nearly half.  This might be ok
      but it worries me a bit

- run-widefdz02t
    - same as run-widefdz01t but fixed guess
    - even more than half with fracdev < 0 now
    - also larger offsets from fiducial run
                  [0.015, 0.015, 0.019, 0.025]
      medians still small though

- we think most faint galaxies look more like disks than bulges
- the prior should be closer to 0 than 1
- where should it be?  0.1 +/- 0.1 ?

# full bulge disk

- run-bd01t
    - fitvd-bd01t
    - full bulge+disk with prior on logTratio
    - fracdev [0,1]
    - fails for cluster example
    ! argh used coellip3
    - on test tile, which has a higher than usual failure
    rate anyway, seeing obj_failure 0.00932007 which is way high

- run-sofbd01t
    - fitvd-sofbd01t
    - obj_failure 0.88% not much better
    
- run-bd02t
    - fitvd-bd02t
    - fracdev [-4,3]
    - fails for cluster example
    ! argh used coellip3
    - obj_failure 0.0010037
 
- run-bd03t
    - fitvd-bd02t
    - fracdev [-0.25, 2.2]
    - fails for cluster example
    ! argh used coellip3
    - obj_failure 0.00136216
