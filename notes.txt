Note there might be astrometry issue that could cause some
of the failures

fracdev priors

    run-v04
        - fracdev truncated norm, very liberal
        failure with object_flags 3.2% in C09

    run-v05
        - fracdev truncated norm [0,1] far fewer failures but
        magdiff with v04 skewed
        failure with object_flags 0.9% in C09

        Also seems to get stuck more in a local minimum at e.g. fracdev=1
        and this is not that uncommon

    run-v06
        - fracdev prior sinh scale 0.2, looks quite similar to v04 in magdiff
        failure a bit better than v04
        failure with object_flags 3.0% in C09

    run-v07
        - fracdev prior sinh scale 0.1
        failure with object_flags 3.4% in C09

    run-v08
        - fracdev prior sinh scale 0.3
        failure with object_flags 3.2% in C09

    run-vdexp01
        - exp
        2.3% failures of object_flags

    run-vdexp02
        - exp ,shifted log-normal T
        2.8% failures of object_flags

    run-vdtcen01
        - fitvd-tcen01 bdf model, but with
              cen prior sigma 0.05 (rather than 0.263 as usual)
        - 2.7% failures of object_flags
            - comparable to the exp model, so maybe this is important

        - if this works, should maybe try with fracdev just normal

    run-dtcen01
        - same as vdtcen01 but des only
        - 2.0% failure

    run-vdfdz01
        - prior centered at zero for fracdev
        2.4%

wide field
----------
- run-wide01t
    - fitvd-wide01t
    - full deblending
    - circular mask
- run-wide02t
    - fitvd-wide02t
    - full deblending
    - uberseg
    - some 0.02 level mag differences showing up

- run-widesof01t
    - fitvd-widesof01t
    - no deblending
    - circular mask
    - mags strongly skewed compared to deblending run wide01t

- run-widesof02t
    - fitvd-widesof02t
    - no deblending
    - ubserseg
    - agrees better with deblending run wide01t
    - agrees best with deblending with uberseg, wide02t
