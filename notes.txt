fracdev priors

    run-v04
        - fracdev truncated norm, very liberal
        failure with object_flags 3.2% in C09

    run-v05
        - fracdev truncated norm [0,1] far fewer failures but
        magdiff with v04 skewed
        failure with object_flags 0.9% in C09

        Also seems to get stuck more in a local minimum at e.g. fracdev=1
        and this is not that uncommon

    run-v06
        - fracdev prior sinh, looks quite similar to v04 in magdiff
        failure a bit better than v04
        failure with object_flags 3.0% in C09
