fracdev priors

    run-v04
        - fracdev truncated norm, very liberal
        failure with object_flags 3.2% in C09

    run-v05
        - fracdev truncated norm [0,1] far fewer failures but
        magdiff with v04 skewed
        failure with object_flags 0.9% in C09

        Also seems to get stuck more in a local minimum at e.g. fracdev=1
        and this is not that uncommon

    run-v06
        - fracdev prior sinh scale 0.2, looks quite similar to v04 in magdiff
        failure a bit better than v04
        failure with object_flags 3.0% in C09

    run-v07
        - fracdev prior sinh scale 0.1
        failure with object_flags 3.4% in C09

    run-v08
        - fracdev prior sinh scale 0.3
        failure with object_flags 3.2% in C09

    run-vdexp01
        - exp
        2.3% failures of object_flags

    run-vdexp02
        - exp ,shifted log-normal T
        2.8% failures of object_flags
